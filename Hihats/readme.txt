These hihats are mapped out to General MIDI (GM) notes as so:

F#3 = Closed hat
G#3 = Pedal (step)
A#3 = Open

If there are additional articulations, they are assigned an octave below:

F#2 = Half open (loose closed)
G#2 = Short duration open
A#2 = Pedal stomp, or a strike with the hat already open
