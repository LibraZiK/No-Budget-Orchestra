The "Salamander Grand Piano" by Alexander Holm is one of the best free sampled pianos. But sampled at every third interval note, fully sustained, at 24 bit 48 KHz, with 16 dynamic layers of notes (plus release, resonance, and pedal samples), it's a 1.82 gig instrument. That can tax the RAM of many computers, especially if used in a mix with other instruments.

So, I set about to create a vastly smaller version, with hopefully little discernable difference in sonic quality. I call this version the "Little Lizard Piano".

The first task was to reduce each sample from 24 to 16 bit. 24 bit is great for recording. (The extra headroom avoids clipping). And you want to mix down in 24 bit, (even if using 16 bit sampled instruments). But for a single pitch, at 1 volume/dynamic level, of a solo instrument, 16 bit is plenty dynamic range (if you record at proper level). So, the instrument was significantly reduced with no discernible loss.

Secondly, the sample rate was reduced from 48 KHz to 44.1. Instruments with strong upper harmonics, such as cymbals, can suffer from such a conversion. But the rate conversion algorithms of today's audio editing software are very good, and Salamander went through the process well.

Third, I experimented with reducing the velocity layers from 16 to 7. Nearly all sample players scale velocity between layers anyway, so having 7 points along the log curve makes for a convincingly seamless dynamic range/response.

Finally, I employed some subtle, and hopefully unnoticeble sample looping. Certainly, in a mix or band setting, it should be undetectable.

The result is that the 1.82 gig salamander shrunk to a little 317 meg lizard. Hopefully, you'll find him to be a chameleon, aptly masquerading as his big brother. And you can easily use him in your mix.

The file "piano_88.sfz" is the complete set, for an 88 key range. The files "piano_76.sfz" and "piano_61.sfz" reduce the note range for 76 and 61 key pianos, cutting the instrument size even more. Use these in a mix if the piano part doesn't stray into the very highest/lowest notes of the full piano (88) range.

Finally, if you don't often play softly, or have a piano part that (mostly) stays above MIDI velocity 40, then the files "piano_88_mix.sfx", "piano_76_mix.sfz" and "piano_61_mix.sfz" compress the lower velocities to save even more RAM. ("piano_61_mix.sfz" is a tiny critter). Where the piano is in the background of a mix, you shouldn't even discern a difference.
