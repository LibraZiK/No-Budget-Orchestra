------======REACTOR FREE INSTRUMENTS======------

These samples and instruments are brought to you by Reactor - the UK's hottest rock band!

You can use them for anything you like - write symphonies - pass them on to your friends - play them to your gods etc. The only thing we'd rather you didn't do is sell them.

All we ask is that when you have a minute take a look around our website = www.reactorsite.com = and have a listen to some of our music. You can buy our debut album 'Emotional Pornography' as a CD or download. Go for it! We need your support...
