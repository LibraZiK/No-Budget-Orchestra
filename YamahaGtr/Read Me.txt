TheoK Yamaha Pacifica

A free Electric Guitar sample library by Theodor Krueger. This is the SFZ format version modified by JeffG.

Theodor's guitar has a Les Paul tone, recorded with a clean, dark (not too bright) pickup setting, and played with a pick.

There are sustained, muted, and hammer-off notes, spaced by 2 whole tones apart across the guitar's note range. Furthermore, each note has 3 or 4 round robins. Finally, there is a generous selection of fret and pick noise waveforms to add realism.
